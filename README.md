If you have problems with installation, let me know. 
I am searching _**collaborators for this project**_. If you have experience and want to collaborate **We are currently developing privately, if you want to join the team please contact us. https://www.linkedin.com/in/nansri108/**



### Why this stock prediction project ?
Things this project **offers** that I did not find in other free projects, are:

+ Testing with _**36 models**_. Multiple combinations features and multiple selections of models, easily expandable (TensorFlow , XGBoost, Sklearn, LSTM, GRU, dense, LINEAR etc  )
+ Threshold and quality _**models evaluation**_
+ Use _**637**_ technical stocks indicators
+ Independent neural network selection of the best technical patterns for each stock
+ Response _**categorical target**_ (do buy, do sell and do nothing) simple and dynamic,  instead of poor and confused, continuous target variable ("the stock will be worth 32.4 in 2 days")
+ Powerful open-market-_**real-time**_ evaluation system 
+ Versatile integration with: Twitter, Telegram and Mail
+ Train Machine Learning model with _**Fresh today stock data**_ 

The project is long and dense, trying to install it without understanding is a mistake, the first thing to do is to run and understand the **[TUTORIAL](#tutorial)**,
